# artificial-neural-network

== What does this application do?

This is a simple python application to build an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict a list of bank accounts (Acc_Closed - (ys)) at risk of closing (what account is more likely to be closed or opened?). Bank_Predictions.csv is the provided dataset. Ignore the first three features of the dataset (Number, Customer_ID, and Last_Name) because they don't impact the prediction. Use the rest features to predict the accounts that are more likely to be closed.
